<h3>Exploring how websites are made with html and css</h3>
<h1>Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>
<p><h3>
<div>HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of tags and attributes to define various elements.
<ol>
Some key points about HTML:
<li>Markup Language: HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It consists of a set of markup tags that define the structure and content of a webpage.</li>
<li>Elements: HTML documents are made up of HTML elements, which are enclosed by tags. Elements can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, forms, and more.</li>
It provides the structure and content of a web page by using a system of tags and attributes.
<li>Tags: HTML tags are used to mark up elements within a document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < >, and most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag</li>
<ul>
There are different tags for:
<li><div>Headings of different levels.</div></li>
<li><div>Paragraphs of text.</div></li>
<li><div>Links to other web pages or resources.</div></li>
<li><div>Inserting images into the webpage.</div></li>
<li><div>Unordered and ordered lists, respectively.</div></li>
<li><div>List items within or lists etc.</div></li>
</ul>
<li>Attributes: HTML tags can have attributes, which provide additional information about an element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and typically consist of a name and a value.</li></ol></div>

<h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
<p><h3>
CSS is a language used to style web pages.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, formatting, and appearance of elements on a web page, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning. CSS allows web developers to separate the structure of a document (HTML) from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the styling of a website across multiple pages.

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styling rules to them. These styling rules consist of properties and values, where properties define the visual characteristics of elements (e.g., color, size, margin), and values specify how those properties should be styled (e.g., blue, 12px, 20px).
It helps make websites look good by controlling things like colors, fonts, and layout
<h2>Selectors</h2>
<h3>Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style.
They can target elements by their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or relationship to other elements.
Examples include element selectors (e.g., p for paragraphs), class selectors (e.g., .class-name), and ID selectors </h3>
<h2>Properties and values</h2>
<h3><div>CSS rules consist of one or more declarations, each containing a property and a value.</div>
<div>Properties define the visual aspects to be changed (e.g., color, font-size, margin)</div>
<div>Values specify how the properties should be styled (e.g., red, 16px, 20px)</div></h3>

<h2>Types of styling in CSS</h2>
<h3>CSS can be applied in three ways:
<div>Inline styling : CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.</div>
<div>Internal styling : CSS is defined within the style element in the head section of an HTML document.
selector { property:value}</div>
External styling : CSS is written in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents using the link element.</h3>
